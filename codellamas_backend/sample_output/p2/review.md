**Code Smell: Duplicate Method**

- **What It Is:** The presence of methods with identical functionality within a class, differing only in name.
- **Why It's a Problem:** Duplicate methods can lead to code bloat, maintenance challenges, and confusion. They violate the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

**Learning Outcomes:**

1. Students should learn how to identify duplicate methods by analyzing code behavior through tests.
2. Understanding that refactoring is not just about removing duplication but also maintaining test coverage ensures that behavior remains consistent.
3. Improve code readability and structure, making it more maintainable for future developers (including themselves).

This exercise emphasizes practical skills in recognizing and resolving common code smells, thus bridging theoretical knowledge with real-world application.
